Download images locally to minimize unnecessary requests to our server. API Usage Overview Retrieve a List of Accommodation Units Swagger documentation To get a list of campsites and accommodation units, use the accommodations/list endpoint. Retrieve Specific Camp Data For details for a specific campsite, use the /camp/data endpoint. In the URL, provide the language and ID parameters. Supported languages are: \"en\", \"de\", \"it\", \"nl\", \"hr\" . Retrieve Data for Individual Accommodation Units The data for individual accommodation units varies by unit type. For mobile home use: Mobile homes endpoint For pitch use: Pitch endpoint For glamping use: Glampings endpoint For apartment use: Apartments endpoint Availability Search We have two main endpoints for checking availability: General Availability Search Swagger documentation This endpoint is used when you need to check the availability for multiple accommodation units at once. It is allowed to call it for each unique availability search. Single Accommodation Availability Swagger documentation To get the most up-to-date availability and pricing for a single accommodation unit, use this endpoint. It's essential for when entering the booking process, as it provides real-time data. Accommodation Unit Calendar Swagger documentation The calendar request can be used to retrieve the daily prices for a specific accommodation unit. The response will only include the available days. This data can also be downloaded locally, and the total price calculation can be performed on your side. Notes: The obtained price is in some cases the base price, without including additional charges, and the total prices may not match the prices obtained through the real-time availability check request, on which the reservation must be based. Note: If you choose to collect and display prices in this way, you must somehow present to guests that this is the base price, as we are unable to provide the additional charges that are added. Booking You will receive more details on how to make a reservation in the sections below of the documentation.","title":"Best practice"},{"location":"best-practices/#best-practices-for-integration","text":"To optimize traffic and performance, we recommend the following practices when working with accommodation data and images: Store accommodation data locally (except for availability and pricing data) to reduce server traffic.

The \"bookingId\" is returned. Description How to fill the booking data depends on the selected payment method. The allowed payment methods are defined at the price list level and are retrieved from the response of the \"/accommodation/availability\" service. Below is a short description of each payment method. No Guarantee payment method (\"no_guarantee\") The reservation will be created in the system, no deposit or credit card guarantee required. Bank Transfer payment method (\"bank_transfer\") The reservation will be created in the system, and the guest is required to make the payment via bank transfer within the due defined in the booking conditions. Credit Card VPP payment method (\"credit_card_vpp\") With this payment method, the payment is processed on our side. We use an external payment gateway to which the user needs to be redirected to complete the payment. Upon successful payment, the user will be redirected to the reservation confirmation page; otherwise, they will be redirected to an error page. The /booking/create service response will return a \"redirectUrl\" string, which should be used to redirect the user for payment completion. The required parameters for this payment method are the redirect URLs, which determine where the user will be redirected based on the payment outcome: \"paymentMethod\": \"credit_card_vpp\", \"redirectUrl\": \"https://example.com/booking-confirmation\", \"cancelPaymentRedirectUrl\": \"https://example.com/booking-failed\", Note: This request should not include credit card details, nor should they be collected on the client side. Credit Card OTA payment method (\"credit_card\") In this payment method, the data is collected on the client side, and valid data must be sent through the booking data in the request. Attention should be paid to the allowed card types. The required fields are: \"paymentMethod\": \"credit_card\", \"creditCardFirstName\": \"John\", \"creditCardLastName\": \"Doe\", \"creditCardType\": \"VISA\", \"creditCardNo\": \"4111111111111111\", \"creditCardVerificationCode\": \"123\", \"creditCardValidThroughMonth\": \"08\", \"creditCardValidThroughYear\": 2025, Note: Partners connecting to our API will not need to use this payment method because they can only access properties that are in the VPP type of partnership.
